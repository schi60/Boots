# App Description:
When you enter the website, you will end up on the house's front lawn. The front yard will display the weather of the day using the weather API. To unlock the door and enter the home, you will need to create an account and log in. In the bedroom, you can browse the book of jokes (Joke API) and the MET Museum book (MET API) you bought recently on your bookshelf during your vacation. In the living room, you can browse the movie catalog and the cat album (Cat API) on the table. In the kitchen, you can flip through the Recipe book (FreeRecipe API) and click on the wall calendar to get facts about holidays (Holiday API).
