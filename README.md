# Description:
Home Sweet Home is a murder mystery game where the goal is to guess who the murderer is. The website is designed like a house, with interactive features and clues posted throughout each room for the user to explore. To enter the house, the user needs to register and log in. At the end of the exploration, you will need to figure out the murderer to win. Found clues can be tracked. After all clues were explored, a question will appear that will ask for who the murderer is in the secret room.
